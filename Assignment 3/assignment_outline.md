Assignment 3 involves implementing an autoencoder for anomaly detection in a video. Students need to train an autoencoder using Keras to encode the frames of a video. After training, they should use the reconstruction loss to identify outlier/anomalous frames by comparing the loss to a threshold. The script should include a function called `predict(frame)` that takes a frame in its original 3D shape `[shape == (44, 60, 3)]` and returns True or False depending on whether the frame is anomalous or not. The deliverable consists of the trained model and a single Python file (PY NOT IPYNB) that loads the model and contains the `predict` function. Additional requirements include ensuring that the code is bug-free, all paths are relative and defined at the top of the PY file, and adherence to the PEP 8 style guide. Grading criteria include successful execution of the two steps described under Deliverable and fulfillment of the additional requirements. The `predict` function will be tested on new frames that were not part of the original video. Lecture slides and the Keras blog about autoencoders are provided as resources for assistance.
