# Assignment 1 Outline

In this assignment, students are tasked with coding and training a neural network using only NumPy, without importing any other libraries. The provided network architecture consists of three fully connected weight layers, three inputs, and a three-class softmax output. The network should have one hidden layer with four neurons and another hidden layer with eight neurons, both having single biases. Data for training and validation is provided in assign1_data.csv, which needs to be loaded using NumPy. The task is to complete and train the network provided with code snippets, ensuring an accuracy above 90% in less than 10 epochs. The submission should be a single Python file that loads the data, builds and trains the network, and prints the accuracy on the test set. Grading criteria include bug-free, PEP8-formatted code, and achieving a test set accuracy above 90%.
